# Java-fx chess project
Hello everyone :wave:, this is a project which started as an asginment for university. That means that there was a deadline for it,
which in turn made me cut some features and overlook a few serious bugs. So I have decided to make a temporary seperation between the 
features that were added before and after the deadline. The features implemented and the bugs that were fixed after the deadline are on
a seperate branch called new-additions. But there is a plan to merge both branches somewhere around January.
